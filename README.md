## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

- **HTML5**: Semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for structured and accessible code.

- **JavaScript**: For future interactivity, such as dynamic menu toggling.
- **External Font**: Icons used for visual enhancement.

## üí° Code Highlights

### 1. **HTML Structure**
   - Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) improve accessibility and readability.
   - Navigation links with active states and a dropdown menu for mobile views.
   - Organized sections: About, Event Info, All Events, and Footer, each with a dedicated purpose and styling.

### 2. **CSS Styling and Layout**

   - **Modular CSS**: Styling is contained in a single CSS file to maintain a clear structure. Each section (e.g., `.about-us`, `.event-info`) has its own set of class-based styles for easy modification.
   - **Flexbox**: Layouts are managed through Flexbox for horizontal and vertical alignment. 
   - **Custom Buttons**: Styled buttons (`.color-button-info`, `.color-button-event`) with rounded corners, and padding for visual consistency.
   - **Responsive Design**: Media queries for screens under 600px width, creating a mobile-friendly experience with a collapsible navigation menu and restructured sections.

### 3. **Responsive Design Techniques**
   - **Responsive Layouts**: The page automatically adjusts to fit screens of all sizes, from mobile to desktop
   - **Hamburger Menu**: A `hamburger-bar` icon is shown on mobile for menu toggling.
   - **Adaptive Layouts**: Content sections (e.g., `.about-us`, `.event-info-box`) adjust between row and column layouts depending on screen size for a consistent user experience.

## üé® Styling Choices

- **Color Scheme**: A consistent color palette is used across backgrounds, text, and buttons, with soft tones and accent colors to match the theme of the event.
- **Typography**: The Roboto font from Google Fonts provides a clean, modern look, with font sizes adjusted based on section context.
- **Design personalized logo**: a logo is created with CSS and HTML specific for this project.
